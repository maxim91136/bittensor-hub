# Release v1.0.0-rc.21

## Highlights
- Full modularization: glitch, refresh, and boot logic split into separate JS files (`glitch.js`, `refresh.js`, `boot.js`)
- Matrix glitch overlay is now globally triggerable and only appears on auto-refresh (not on click)
- Overlay container for Matrix glitch added to `index.html`
- All code, comments, and release notes in English
- Docs and workflow untouched, but all logic and UI changes are reflected in this release
- No destructive actions or tag deletions
- Bugfixes and code hygiene improvements

## Details
- `glitch.js`: Handles Matrix glitch overlay, exposes `showMatrixGlitch()` globally
- `refresh.js`: Handles auto-refresh logic, triggers glitch overlay after each refresh
- `boot.js`: Handles terminal boot overlay logic
- `index.html`: Loads all new JS modules and includes the glitch overlay container
- No manual refresh button; glitch only triggers on auto-refresh
- All documentation files (`docs/`) and previous release notes retained

This release finalizes the modular refactor and ensures a clean, maintainable, and professional codebase. All features are tested and ready for production.
