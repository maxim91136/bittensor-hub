# v1.0.0-rc.21.3.2.1 (2025-12-06)

A small maintenance release that fixes a corrupted `VERSION` file and ensures release metadata is consistent across docs and automated checks.

## Highlights

- **Fix:** Restored `VERSION` file to a clean single-line value (`v1.0.0-rc.21.3.2.1`) after earlier edits accidentally introduced code fences and duplicate lines.
- **Docs:** Updated `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` to reference the corrected release version.
- **Release:** Created annotated tag and GitHub release for `v1.0.0-rc.21.3.2.1`.

## Notes

- This is a housekeeping release to correct release metadata; no functional code changes.
- Recommended: hard-refresh deployed site or re-run post-deploy smoke checks to verify the deployed `/VERSION` endpoint returns the expected single-line value.
