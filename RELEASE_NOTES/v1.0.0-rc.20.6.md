# v1.0.0-rc.20.6 (2025-12-05)

### Changed
- Volume signal behaviour: `Slightly bearish` (Volume ↓ + Price ↓ with price ≤ -2%) now maps to **red** (stronger visual alert). Client tooltip and logic were updated to ensure this market condition is more visible.
- Documentation: `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` updated to reflect the new mapping and version bump.

### Notes
- `VERSION` bumped to `v1.0.0-rc.20.6`.
- This release is primarily a UX/visibility adjustment to improve clarity of market-state alerts on the dashboard.
