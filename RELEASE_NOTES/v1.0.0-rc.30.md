# Release Notes: v1.0.0-rc.30

**Release Date:** December 11, 2025

## Highlights

This release introduces the **TAO Distribution Card** - a new dashboard feature that shows wealth distribution metrics across the Bittensor network. Ever wondered how much TAO you need to be in the Top 1%? Now you know.

## New Features

### TAO Distribution Card
A new dashboard card displaying wealth distribution metrics:

- **Percentile Thresholds**: Shows exactly how much TAO is needed to be in the Top 1%, 3%, 5%, and 10% of holders
- **Wallet Brackets**: Displays the count of wallets holding >10,000, >1,000, >100, and >10 TAO
- **Live Data**: Sample of 20,000 top wallets analyzed weekly
- **Credit**: Inspired by [@RBS_HODL](https://x.com/RBS_HODL) who pioneered monthly distribution posts on X

### Current Distribution Snapshot (Dec 11, 2025)
| Percentile | TAO Required |
|------------|-------------|
| Top 1% | ≥ 395 τ |
| Top 3% | ≥ 91 τ |
| Top 5% | ≥ 42 τ |
| Top 10% | ≥ 13 τ |

## Technical Improvements

### Graceful Degradation for Distribution Fetch
The distribution workflow now handles API failures robustly:

- **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 attempts per failed request with progressive backoff (30s → 60s → 90s)
- **Graceful Degradation**: If 5,000+ wallets already fetched before failure, continues with partial data instead of failing completely
- **Battle Tested**: Today's run hit a timeout at page 91 (18,000 wallets) - the retry kicked in, waited 30s, and successfully completed all 100 pages (20,000 wallets)

### Weekly Distribution Workflow
- Runs every Sunday at 03:00 UTC
- Fetches 20,000 top wallets from Taostats API
- Calculates percentile thresholds and bracket distributions
- Stores results in Cloudflare KV
