# Release v1.0.0-rc.18.3

**Release Date:** December 2, 2025

## 🐛 Critical Fixes

### Emission Calculation Fixed
The AVG. EMISSION / DAY calculation was showing incorrect values (~5,781 TAO/day instead of ~7,185 TAO/day) due to data anomalies in the issuance history.

#### Root Cause
- Two large issuance "drops" in the history data (Nov 24 and Dec 2) caused by API/data errors
- Total issuance can never decrease, so these drops were corrupting the emission calculation
- The old first/last delta method was sensitive to these anomalies

#### The Fix
1. **Sanitize History**: New `sanitize_history()` function detects and corrects issuance drops
   - Applies cumulative correction to all samples after a drop
   - Ensures monotonically increasing issuance values
2. **Robust Statistics**: Switched from first/last delta to **winsorized mean** of interval rates
   - Filters anomalous rates (<5,000 or >9,000 TAO/day)
   - 10% trim on each end for outlier resistance
3. **Result**: Emission now correctly shows ~7,185 TAO/day

### Volume Signal Ampelsystem Completed
Added missing condition for `Volume ↓ + Price stable` case.

#### Before
- Volume -12.6% + Price +1.1% → fell through to "neutral"
- Old red signal persisted incorrectly

#### After
- Per Readme spec: Volume ↓ + any = 🟡 Yellow
- Now correctly shows yellow glow with "Stable market conditions" tooltip
