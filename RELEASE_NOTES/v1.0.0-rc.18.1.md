# Release v1.0.0-rc.18.1

**Release Date:** December 1, 2025

This is a small, stability-focused follow-up to RC18.

## Fixes and Cleanup
- Removed duplicate CSS blocks (second dynamic tooltip, second chart skeleton + keyframes, duplicate chart container, redundant pill-value rule).
- Unified Light Mode pill value styling (color, Safari fill, weight).
- Added `prefers-reduced-motion` support to disable pulses and glows for users who opt out of animations.

## Notes
- No visual changes relative to RC18; behavior and layout remain identical.
- Slightly smaller CSS footprint and lower risk of conflicting overrides.
