# Release v1.0.0-rc.16.3

**Release Date:** December 1, 2025

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### No Flash on Auto-Refresh

Fixed the issue where the volume signal animation would briefly flash to green during the 60-second auto-refresh cycle.

#### The Problem
- On each refresh, all blink classes were removed first, then new class added
- The brief moment without any class caused default hover styles (green) to show
- `offsetWidth` reflow caused additional animation interruption

#### The Fix
- **If signal unchanged** → Don't touch classes at all, just update tooltip
- **If signal changed** → Add new class FIRST, then remove old classes
- Removed `offsetWidth` reflow hack - no longer needed
- Animation now stays perfectly smooth across refreshes
