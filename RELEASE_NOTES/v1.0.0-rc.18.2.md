# Release v1.0.0-rc.18.2

**Release Date:** December 1, 2025

## ✨ New
- **"only 21 Mio." header scribble:** Decorative handwritten note in the top-left of the header, using the Caveat font with a slight diagonal tilt. White in dark mode, black in light mode.

## 🛠️ Changed
- **Circ Supply card:** Label shortened to "Circ Supply"; value now shows only the circulating amount (e.g., "10.42M τ"), without the "/ 21M" suffix.

## ✅ Fixes
- Mobile layout and toggle button alignment refined for iPhone and iPad parity.

## Notes
- Desktop, iPad, and iPhone layouts all verified; no visual regressions from RC18.1.
