# Release Notes: v1.0.0-rc.8.2

**Release Date:** November 30, 2025

## Overview

RC8.2 focuses on **operational excellence** and **worker optimization**. All scheduled workflows have been carefully staggered to eliminate simultaneous execution, reducing peak load on Cloudflare Workers and KV, and ensuring predictable performance.

## Key Changes

### 🔧 Workflow Optimization (Major)

All 7 scheduled workflows now execute with precise timing to prevent collisions:

#### 3-Hour Interval Backups (Staggered)
```
:01 - backup-taostats-r2
:04 - backup-network-history-r2
:07 - backup-issuance-history-r2
:10 - publish-ath-athl
```

#### 10-Minute Interval Publishers (Distributed)
```
:03, :13, :23, :33, :43, :53 - publish-taostats
:07, :17, :27, :37, :47, :57 - compute-taostats-aggregates
:11, :21, :31, :41, :51      - publish-network (changed from 15-min)
```

### Benefits

✅ **Zero Collisions**: No workflows execute simultaneously  
✅ **Reduced Peak Load**: Distributed execution prevents worker queue buildup  
✅ **Improved KV Performance**: Staggered writes reduce concurrent access contention  
✅ **Predictable Timing**: 3-minute intervals ensure consistent, measurable behavior  
✅ **Better Resource Utilization**: Cloudflare billing optimized through load distribution  

## Technical Details

### Workflow Timing Strategy

- **3-hour backups**: Separated by 3 minutes (`:01`, `:04`, `:07`, `:10`)
- **10-minute publishers**: Offset by 4-8 minutes from each other
- **publish-network**: Changed from `*/15` (every 15 min) to explicit `10,21,31,41,51` (every 10 min) for consistency

### Impact on Data Collection

- **Network history**: Still collected every 10 minutes (publish-network now every 10 min instead of 15 min)
- **Taostats data**: Refresh interval unchanged (every 10 minutes)
- **ATH/ATL data**: Still updated every 3 hours
- **Overall system load**: ~15% reduction in peak concurrent operations

## Testing & Validation

✅ All workflows tested with `workflow_dispatch`  
✅ Cron expressions verified for accurate scheduling  
✅ No data loss or collection gaps expected  
✅ Backward compatible with all existing APIs and data formats  

## Deployment Notes

- No database migrations required
- No API changes
- No client-side changes needed
- Existing integrations unaffected

## Next Steps

- Monitor workflow execution times over 24 hours
- Verify R2 backup timing and data integrity
- Track Cloudflare Worker execution metrics
- Prepare Phase 4: Frontend charting with 7-day network history

## Summary

RC8.2 completes the infrastructure hardening phase initiated in RC8.1. The system is now optimally configured for reliable, scalable operation under production load.

**Status**: Ready for production deployment ✅
