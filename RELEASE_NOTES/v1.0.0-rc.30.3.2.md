# Release Notes: v1.0.0-rc.30.3.2

**Release Date:** December 12, 2025

## Highlights

This release fixes layout issues in the Market Conditions card's Signal metric, making it consistent with other metrics in the grid.

## UI Improvements

### Market Conditions Signal Metric Redesign

**Problem:** The Signal metric had a horizontal layout with icon, label, and value that caused spacing issues and visual inconsistency with other metrics.

**Solution:** Redesigned to standard vertical layout:
- **Icon removed** (display: none)
- **Label on top**: "SIGNAL" (0.85em desktop, 0.7em mobile)
- **Value below**: "Caution", "Bullish", "Bearish", etc. (2em desktop, 1.5em mobile)

**Before:**
```
🔴 SIGNAL Caution
```

**After:**
```
SIGNAL
Caution
```

This matches the visual structure of Volume 24h, Price 24h, and Trend metrics.

## Technical Details

- Removed horizontal flexbox hacks (negative margins, complex gap calculations)
- Uses standard vertical flexbox with `order` property
- Clean, maintainable CSS
- Consistent spacing across all metrics
