# v1.0.0-rc.21.2 (2025-12-06)

A compact, focused UX & polish release that tightens the Fear & Greed (F&G) experience and fixes several light-mode and layout edge-cases.

### Highlights

- UX: Timeline labels expanded and reordered (Now → Yesterday → Week → Month) for clearer reading and quick comparisons.
- Style: F&G timeline text switched to monospace/console style for a Matrix-like look with responsive sizes.
- Fix: Light-mode spoon asset and loader adjustments — reliable white-background PNG fallback for Light Mode and improved toggle behavior.
- UI: "there is no spoon..." Matrix easter-egg moved to the F&G card header to prevent overlap with timeline content.
- Dev: Minor JS/CSS cleanup and small accessibility/readability improvements.

### Notes

This release is low-risk and purely frontend-focused. Recommended: hard-refresh or open in incognito to validate the new assets and timeline rendering across devices.

If you'd like, I can draft the GitHub Release notes from this file and/or post a short announcement to X (Twitter) for you.
