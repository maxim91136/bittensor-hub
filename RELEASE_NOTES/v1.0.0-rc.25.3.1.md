# v1.0.0-rc.25.3.1 (2025-12-08)

Mobile optimization patch for Market Phase section.

## Changed

### Market Phase Section Mobile Optimization
**Problem**: Long text in Market Phase section (e.g., "Market: Bearish (3d avg is 23.0% below 7d avg)") was overflowing or difficult to read on small screens.

**Solution**: Progressive font size reduction and improved text wrapping.

- **Base (all screens)**:
  - Added `word-wrap: break-word`
  - Added `overflow-wrap: break-word`
  - Ensures long words/text break gracefully

- **Tablet (≤768px)**:
  - Font size: `0.75em` (from default `0.8em`)
  - Line height: `1.45` (more compact)

- **Mobile (≤480px)**:
  - Font size: `0.72em` (even more compact)
  - Line height: `1.4` (tighter spacing)
  - Added `hyphens: auto` for automatic word breaking

## Impact

- **Better Readability**: Text now fits within card boundaries on all devices
- **No Overflow**: Long descriptive text wraps properly
- **Consistent Experience**: Maintains readability while being more compact
- **Professional Polish**: Text doesn't break the layout on narrow screens

## Example
Text like:
```
📉 Market: Bearish (3d avg is 23.0% below 7d avg)
🔻 Sentiment: Extreme Fear (20) — capitulation phase
```

Now wraps cleanly on mobile instead of overflowing or requiring horizontal scroll.
