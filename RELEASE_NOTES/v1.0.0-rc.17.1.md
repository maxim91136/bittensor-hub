# Release v1.0.0-rc.17.1

**Release Date:** December 1, 2025

## ✨ UI Improvements
- **Price Pill Redesign**: Mirrors the halving pill aesthetics with a cool blue shell and slimmer right-edge accent that flips between green (24h up) and red (24h down).
- **Breathing Animation Return**: The entire price pill now runs a calm 6.5s pulse (like the halving pill) so both hero pills share the same visual rhythm without distracting edge artifacts.

## 🛠️ Fixes & Cleanup
- **Indicator Logic Resilience**: CSS specificity + JS class handling were tightened so the pill color never desyncs from actual price direction, even after rapid API refreshes.
- **Style Hygiene**: Removed unused keyframes and translated the remaining inline comments to English to keep the stylesheet readable for all contributors.

## ✅ Verification Checklist
- Confirm `#taoPricePill` switches to the correct green/red stripe once the 24h change crosses ±0.5%.
- Toggle price data (e.g., mock positive vs. negative change) and ensure the breathing pulse remains smooth at 6.5s in both states.
- Run through the hero pills on light + dark mode to verify contrast stayed compliant.
