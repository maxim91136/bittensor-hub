# v1.0.0-rc.23.7 (2025-12-07)

Complete tooltip system rebuild for professional UX.

### Added

- **Weekend Context Indicator**: Volume tooltips now show "📅 Weekend — typically lower activity" on Saturdays and Sundays (UTC-based)
- **Modern Tooltip System**: Complete rebuild with:
  - TooltipManager class for centralized control
  - Timer cleanup system (no leaks)
  - Element-based positioning (stable anchoring)
  - Smart auto-flip (adapts to viewport)
  - Toggle support (click same element to close)
  - ESC + outside click support
  - Full keyboard navigation (focus/blur)

### Changed

- **Tooltip Design**:
  - Modern blur backdrop effect
  - Smooth scale animation on show/hide
  - X-button on all touch tooltips
  - Light mode optimized
  - Consistent behavior across badges, pills, and cards

### Fixed

- **Position Stability**: Tooltips no longer shift when clicking repeatedly
- **Timer Issues**: Timers properly cancelled, no inheritance between tooltips
- **Stable Anchoring**: Tooltips stay fixed relative to target element
- **Keyboard Access**: Full support for screen readers and keyboard-only navigation

### Technical

- Tooltip positioning based on target element rect, not event coordinates
- Smart vertical flip when insufficient space
- Proper cleanup on hide (timers, classes, attributes)
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA, role, keyboard)

### Files Changed

- `script.js`: TooltipManager class + weekend detection + setup refactor
- `style.css`: Modern tooltip styles with animations
- `VERSION`: Bumped to v1.0.0-rc.23.7
