# Release v1.0.0-rc.15

**Release Date:** November 30, 2025

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

### Emission Calculation Fixed

Fixed a significant bug in the 7-day and 30-day emission rate calculations that was causing **~10% underreporting** of daily TAO emissions.

#### The Problem
- `emission_7d` showed **6,517 TAO/day** instead of the actual **~7,184 TAO/day**
- Root cause: Data gaps in the first days of issuance history collection (Nov 23-24)
- One day with only partial data showed ~1,432 TAO/day instead of ~7,180, pulling down the average
- This caused halving projections to be off by ~2 days

#### The Fix
- Added **standard deviation check** (threshold: 500 TAO/day) to detect unreliable data
- If SD exceeds threshold → automatically fallback to more recent, cleaner data periods (4d/3d/2d)
- Applied same logic to `emission_30d` (requires >= 14 days of clean data before using 30d average)

#### Results

| Metric | Before (buggy) | After (fixed) |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| `emission_7d` | 6,517 TAO/day ❌ | **7,184 TAO/day** ✅ |
| `emission_sd_7d` | 1,538 (unstable) | **~55-70** (stable) ✅ |
| `emission_30d` | 6,517 TAO/day | **7,184 TAO/day** (fallback to 7d) |
| Halving ETA | ~14 days (wrong) | **~12 days** (correct) |

## Technical Details

**Files Changed:**
- `.github/scripts/fetch_network.py` - Emission calculation logic

**Algorithm Improvements:**
1. Direct issuance delta over time span (instead of averaging interval rates)
2. Standard deviation monitoring for data quality
3. Automatic fallback to shorter, more reliable periods when data quality is poor
4. 30d emission now requires >= 14 days of clean history before activation

*This release prioritizes data accuracy for halving projections.*
