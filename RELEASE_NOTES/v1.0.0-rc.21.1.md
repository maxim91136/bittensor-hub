# v1.0.0-rc.21.1 (2025-12-06)

Short maintenance/UX patch focused on the Fear & Greed (F&G) card and light-mode rendering.

### Highlights

- Fix: Light-mode spoon asset — use white-background PNG so the spoon displays correctly on light cards and PWAs.
- Fix: Theme toggle now targets the correct image element (`#fngSpoonImage`) and the `useFngGraphics()` loader defaults to the black/white PNG assets for reliable fallbacks.
- UX: Left-side F&G status badge (FEAR / NEUTRAL / GREED) polished and small barometer label hidden to avoid duplication.
- CSS: Improved light-mode overrides for the F&G card so inner panel and spoon remain readable (reduced blend-mode reliance).
- Tests: `testSpoonGauge()` helper kept in sync to allow manual QA in-browser.

### Notes

This is a small, low-risk patch intended to improve cross-theme consistency (dark vs light) and fix a light-mode asset fallback issue observed in some browsers (notably Safari / PWA builds). If you want, I can also create the GitHub Release draft from this tag.
