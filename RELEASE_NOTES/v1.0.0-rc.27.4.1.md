# v1.0.0-rc.27.4.1 - Leaderboard Ranking Indicators

**Release Date:** 2025-12-10

## What's Fixed

### Leaderboard Ranking Changes Now Display

The ▲ ▼ NEW ranking change indicators now work correctly for all leaderboards:

- **Subnets**: Shows position changes (e.g., SN4 ▲1, SN51 ▼1)
- **Validators**: Shows validator ranking movements
- **Wallets**: Shows wallet position changes

### Two Fixes Applied

1. **History Data Parsing**: Fixed to read from `entries` array with `id` field instead of legacy format
2. **24h Comparison Window**: Changed from comparing with last ~30 min snapshot to oldest available (~24h), showing meaningful daily changes instead of minute-to-minute stability

## Technical Details

- Fetch 96 history snapshots (~24h at 15-min intervals)
- Compare current rankings with oldest snapshot
- Display ▲ for rank improvements, ▼ for drops, NEW for entries
