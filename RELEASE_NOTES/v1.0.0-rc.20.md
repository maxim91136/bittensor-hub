# v1.0.0-rc.20

## Highlights

- Add lightweight seasonal snowfall overlay (active Dec 1 → Jan 31).
- Add NYE visuals: sparkles, confetti bursts, and small rockets (active Dec 31 & Jan 1).
- Effects respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and are toggleable via `?holiday=1` and `?nye=1` query parameters or `body` classes.
- Holiday visuals isolated in overlay containers to avoid changing logo SVG.

## Notes

- Cherry-picked commit: `b17ad377f4e2370d6b580ef7148a04ff6fee158c` (feature/holiday-snow)
- Merged into `main` (commit on main: `37c595b`).

## Testing

- Local preview URLs:
  - Snow only: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html?holiday=1`
  - NYE only: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html?nye=1`

## Security

- No new dependencies added. Frontend-only changes.

## Notes for release

If your production deployment watches `main`, this RC should be picked up by your CI/CD pipeline automatically.
