# v1.0.0-rc.2 (Release Candidate)

## Highlights
- TAO Tensor Law embed card under the price chart with live iframe and fallback preview image.
- Fullscreen modal to open TAO Tensor Law without reloading the embed; icon-only magnifying-glass action.
- Mobile overlay CTA to open TAO Tensor Law full-screen to avoid clipped tooltips on phones.
- Mobile-first height improvements: more of the embedded chart and the disclaimer are visible without clipping.

## Added
- TAO Tensor Law embedded iframe with fallback image for roadblocks and X-Frame-Options.
- Fullscreen modal to hold the iframe without a page reload, preserving state.
- A compact `icon-btn` (magnifying glass) action with accessible labels.
- Mobile-only overlay for quick modal use and to avoid tap/tooltip clipping while keeping the iframe interactive on larger screens.

## Fixed
- Overlap and layout issues in the TAO card header (removed the inline `i` info badge, fixed header reflow).
- Tooltip binding now excludes `.taotensor-card`, preventing accidental or orphaned tooltips.
- Light Mode contrast fixes for CTA and overlay text to ensure readability.
- Improved fallback handling when an embed is blocked: fallback preview and external link are shown correctly.

## Changed
- `script.js` enhancements: modal logic, overlay management, and fallback detection (more robust and accessible behavior).
- Increased embed min-height for mobile/responsive use, tuned with `clamp()` values to better match Miner Map appearance.

## Notes
- This release candidate continues iterative improvements to the dashboard UI and embed UX. Monitor real-world usage and embed request volume; we may add telemetry (e.g., `embed-ping`) later.

If you want me to publish this to GitHub Releases as a pre-release now, say so and I'll do it via `gh` CLI if available. Otherwise, this file serves as canonical release notes that we can either attach to a release or paste into the GitHub release UI manually.
