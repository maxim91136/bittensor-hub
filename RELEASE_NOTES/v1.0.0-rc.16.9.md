# Release Notes — v1.0.0-rc.16.9

**Release Date:** 2025-12-01

## Summary

Critical fix for Volume signal card border conflict with TaoStats widget. The root cause was finally identified after extensive debugging: TaoStats widget was overriding signal card borders via both CSS and inline JavaScript styles.

## Fixed

### TaoStats Widget Conflict
- **Root Cause**: TaoStats widget's `pulse-up` class was setting green border with `!important` in CSS
- **Second Issue**: TaoStats JS was also setting inline styles on parent card, overriding all CSS rules
- **Solution**: Added `:not(.blink-*)` selectors to TaoStats CSS and conditional checks in TaoStats JS
- Signal cards now maintain intended gray border with colored glow (red/green/yellow/orange)

### Code Cleanup
- Removed 45 lines of workaround code (duplicate CSS overrides, inline style hacks)
- Cleaned up multiple failed fix attempts from RC16.7-16.8
- Simplified to single source of truth for signal card styling

## Technical Details

The issue occurred because:
1. Volume card gets **two** systems applied:
   - Our signal system: `blink-red`, `blink-green`, etc. with gray border + colored glow
   - TaoStats widget: `pulse-up`, `pulse-down` with green/red border for volume trends

2. TaoStats override was winning because:
   - CSS: `.stat-card.pulse-up { border: 2px solid rgba(16,185,129,0.4) !important; }`
   - JS: `parentCard.style.border = '2px solid rgba(16,185,129,0.40)'`

3. Fixed by excluding signal cards from TaoStats styling:
   - CSS: Added `:not(.blink-green):not(.blink-red):not(.blink-yellow):not(.blink-orange)`
   - JS: Added conditional check before applying border styles

## Lessons Learned

**Human debugging is irreplaceable**: User found the issue by inspecting DevTools and seeing `taostats-card.css:53` as the source. AI code analysis missed this cross-component conflict.

## Upgrade Notes

No breaking changes. Pure bug fix.
