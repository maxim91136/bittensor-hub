# v1.0.0-rc.20.4 (2025-12-05)

## Summary
RC20.4 is a small enhancement release focusing on UX/UI polish and performance tradeoffs for holiday visual effects. The release consolidates recent incremental improvements and retains full backward compatibility.

## Added
- No major features added; this release is focused on refinements and accessibility improvements.

## Changed
- Snowfall visual update: reduced number of snowflakes by 50% across all viewports to lower visual density and CPU/GPU impact.
- Matrix overlay: reduced font size for better visual balance and less dominance over dashboard content.
- Consolidated Light Mode styling for snowflakes: unified behavior between `prefers-color-scheme` and `body.light-bg` toggle to ensure consistent color across environments.

## Fixed
- Light Mode contrast for snowflakes: switched to darker blue in Light Mode for reliable contrast on a variety of screens.

## Notes
- Non-functional changes only; this release should be safe to apply immediately.
- For maintainers: See `RELEASE_NOTES/v1.0.0-rc.20.3.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES/v1.0.0-rc.20.3.1.md` for prior updates.
