# Release Notes: v1.0.0-rc.30.3

**Release Date:** December 11, 2025

## Highlights

This release fixes a **critical bug** in the Nakamoto Coefficient calculation for validators. The previous calculation was incorrectly measuring against only the top 100 validators' stake instead of the total network stake.

## Bug Fix

### Nakamoto Coefficient Calculation

**Problem:** The Nakamoto coefficient was calculated against the sum of the top 100 validators' stake (~1.8M TAO) instead of the total network stake (~2.44M TAO).

**Impact:** Showed Nakamoto=3 (Critical) when the actual value is **Nakamoto=7** (Low).

**Fix:** `calculate_nakamoto()` now accepts an optional `total` parameter, and `analyze_validators()` passes the actual `total_stake` from the API.

```python
# Before (wrong)
nakamoto = calculate_nakamoto(stakes)  # Uses sum of top 100 only

# After (correct)
nakamoto = calculate_nakamoto(stakes, total=total_stake)  # Uses total network stake
```

## Current Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Score** | 63.2/100 (Moderate) |
| **Validator Nakamoto** | 7 |
| **Subnet Nakamoto** | 15 |
| **Gini Index** | 0.31 |

### Component Scores

| Component | Score | Weight |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Wallets | 65 | 30% |
| Validators | 38.8 | 30% |
| Subnets | 80.2 | 40% |

## Lessons Learned

Always verify calculated metrics against real-world data before publishing. The user caught this error by manually checking that the top 3 validators only held ~30% of stake (not 51%), proving the Nakamoto coefficient of 3 was impossible.
