# v1.0.0-rc.25.4 (2025-12-08)

Visual polish - Market Phase color correction.

## Fixed

### Market Phase Colors
**Problem**: Bearish market phase text (negative values like "22.8% below 7d avg") was displaying in green, which was confusing and contradicted the negative sentiment.

**Solution**: Corrected CSS color mapping to match market sentiment:

**Dark Mode:**
- 📉 **Bearish** (negative) → Red text (#ef4444) + red border
- 📈 **Bullish** (positive) → Green text (#22c55e) + green border
- ➡️ **Neutral** → Yellow text (#eab308) + yellow border
- Default → White/gray (neutral)

**Light Mode:**
- 📉 **Bearish** (negative) → Red text (#dc2626) + red border
- 📈 **Bullish** (positive) → Green text (#16a34a) + green border
- ➡️ **Neutral** → Yellow text (#ca8a04) + yellow border
- Default → Gray (neutral)

## Impact

- **Instant Recognition**: Market sentiment immediately clear from color
- **Visual Consistency**: Colors now match meaning across entire card
- **Better UX**: No confusion between positive/negative market phases
- **Professional Polish**: Correct color psychology (red=danger, green=positive)

## Example

**Before:**
```
📉 Market: Bearish (3d avg is 22.8% below 7d avg)
🔻 Sentiment: Extreme Fear (20) — capitulation phase
```
Was displayed in **green** (incorrect)

**After:**
Same text now displays in **red** (correct) ✅
