### Sound Design Philosophy

- **Subtle & Professional**: Low volume levels (0.02-0.06 gain)
- **Bass-Heavy**: Frequencies range from 110Hz to 660Hz (no high-pitched beeps)
- **Short Duration**: Most sounds under 0.2 seconds
- **Smooth Envelopes**: Linear ramps for natural fade-in/fade-out
- **Contextual**: Different sounds for different actions

### User Experience

- Sounds disabled by default for first-time visitors
- One-click toggle to enable/disable all sounds
- Settings persist across sessions
- No performance impact when disabled
- Works on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Notes

Pure frontend enhancement. The sound system is completely procedural - no external audio files required. All sounds are generated in real-time using the Web Audio API, ensuring zero licensing concerns and minimal bandwidth usage.

Recommended: Test on actual devices to experience the full Matrix-themed audio feedback system. The bass-heavy design works particularly well with headphones or quality speakers.
