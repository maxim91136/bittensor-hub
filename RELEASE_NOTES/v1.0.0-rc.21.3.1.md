# v1.0.0-rc.21.3.1 (2025-12-06)

A small, low-risk frontend follow-up that cleans up a duplicated link, improves default chart behavior, and persists a minor UI preference.

## Highlights

- **About card:** Removed the duplicate clickable `alternative.me` link from the About section while keeping the attribution text. The only visible source link remains in the Disclaimer & Data Sources grid.
- **Default Price Chart:** The default timeframe on first load is now **3D** (previously 7D) for a more compact short-term overview.
- **Persist timeframe selection:** Users' chosen chart timeframe is persisted in `localStorage` under the key `priceRange` and restored on subsequent visits (client-side only). Clearing site data/localStorage will reset to the default 3D.

## Files changed (high level)

- `index.html` — About text adjusted (link removed); Price Chart 3D button active moved.
- `script.js` — Default `currentPriceRange` set from `localStorage` (fallback to '3'); save selection on button click and restore active button on load.
- `RELEASE_NOTES/v1.0.0-rc.21.3.1.md` — this file.
- `VERSION` — bumped to `v1.0.0-rc.21.3.1`.

## Notes

- Frontend-only changes; recommended a hard-refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) or open in incognito to ensure updated assets/scripts are loaded.
