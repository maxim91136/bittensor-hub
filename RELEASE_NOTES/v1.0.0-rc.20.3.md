# v1.0.0-rc.20.3 (2025-12-05)

## Summary
A minor patch release focused on UI fixes and UX refinements introduced in RC20 and subsequent patches. This release resolves a visual regression affecting the holiday snowfall, restores the Matrix-style glitch look-and-feel, and adds a handful of small but important stability and UX improvements.

## Added
- Release notes and documentation created for RC20.3.

## Changed
- Matrix glitch overlay behaviour refined: DOM-based RC20.2 look restored, improved color palette (more emphasis on darker greens), horizontal layout across dashboard width.
- Matrix glitch now triggers only during automated refreshes (not on manual refresh clicks).

## Fixed
- Snowfall: Light Mode snowflakes no longer render as pure white—updated styles for better contrast and uniform blue tone when Light Mode is enabled.
- Width & alignment: Matrix overlay now correctly centers and spans up to two rows as intended.
- Initialization: Ensured dashboard update functions are properly globalized so the UI loads consistently.

## Dev / Docs
- `VERSION` updated to `v1.0.0-rc.20.3`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` updated with RC20.3 highlights.
- README updated to point to `v1.0.0-rc.20.3` as latest release.

## Notes
- This release is non-pre-release and considered safe for immediate deployment to production.
- All changes were implemented with careful deploy testing and prior backups of `main` to preserve history.

Thanks to everyone who helped debug the UI issues — enjoy the nicer holiday visuals!
