# Release v1.0.0-rc.18.6

**Release Date:** December 3, 2025

## Summary

This release simplifies the Ampelsystem signal matrix and improves documentation accuracy.

## Changes

### Ampelsystem Simplification

**Merged 'Stable' and 'Neutral' into single state:**
- Previously had separate "Stable" (vol↓ + price stable) and "Neutral" (all under threshold)
- Now unified as **"Stable"** for all quiet market conditions
- Reduced from 7 signal states to 6

### Final Signal Matrix

| Signal | Condition | Color |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| 🟢 **Bullish** | Vol ↑ + Price ↑ | Green |
| 🔴 **Bearish** | Vol ↑ + Price ↓ | Red |
| 🟠 **Watch** | Vol ↑ + Price stable | Orange |
| 🟡 **Caution** | Vol ↓ + Price ↑ | Yellow |
| 🟡 **Consolidation** | Vol ↓ + Price ↓ | Yellow |
| ⚪ **Stable** | Quiet market | White |

### Documentation Updates

- **README Features**: Complete rewrite with actual feature highlights
- **Removed misleading terms**: No more "live" or "real-time" claims
- **Fixed Halving description**: Now correctly states "issuance-based" not "block-based"

## Files Changed

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `script.js` | Merged Stable/Neutral, renamed to "Stable" |
| `README.md` | Revamped Features section, fixed descriptions |

## Upgrade Notes

No manual intervention required. Frontend-only changes.
